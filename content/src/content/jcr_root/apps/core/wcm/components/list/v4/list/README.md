List (v4)
====
List component written in HTL that renders a configurable collection of items or content.

## Features
* Multiple sources:
  * List page children
  * List tagged items
  * List query result
  * List static items
* Ordering and limit
* Styles

### Use Object
The List component uses the `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.List` Sling model as its Use-object.

### Component Policy Configuration Properties
The following configuration properties are used:

1. `./dateFormat` - defines the formatting string for when the list items are set to render their last modification date;
2. `./disableChildren` - allows to disable the ability to build a list from the child pages of a root page
3. `./disableStatic` - allows to disable the ability to build a list with static elements
4. `./disableSearch` - allows to disable the ability to build a list using search results
5. `./disableTags` - allows to disable the ability to build a list using the tagged child pages of a root page

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this List component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./listFrom` - defines the source of this List; possible values:
  * `children` - the list is built from the child pages of a root page
  * `static` - the list is built from a statically defined collection of pages and external links
  * `search` - the list is built from the search results of a query
  * `tags` - the list is built from the tagged children pages of a root page
2. `./parentPage` - defines the root page when the `./listFrom` property is set to `children`
3. `./childDepth` - defines the max depth for children pages, when the `./listFrom` property is set to `children`
4. `./static` - name of the child JCR node where the list elements are stored, when the `./listFrom` property is set to `static`,
               as a list of `item` nodes with the following properties:
               `linkURL` - stores the page path or external links,
               `linkTarget` - stores the link target,
               `linkText` - stores the link text.
               When `./listFrom` property is set to `static`, the `./maxItems` property is ignored.
5. `./query` - defines the search query, when the `./listFrom` property is set to `search`
6. `./searchIn` - defines where to start the search, when the `./listFrom` property is set to `search`
7. `./tagsSearchRoot` - defines the root path of the tag search, when the `./listFrom` property is set to `tags`
8. `./tags` - defines the tags list to search for, when the `./listFrom` property is set to `tags`
9. `./tagsMatch` - defines if the results of the tag search have to match all tags or just some of them,
when the `./listFrom` property is set to `tags`; possible values: `any` and `all`
10. `./orderBy` - defines what criterion is used for ordering the list items: the item's title or the
last modification date of the item; possible values: `title`, `modified`
11. `./sortOrder` - defines the sorting order; possible values: `asc`, `desc`
12. `./maxItems` - defines the maximum number of items rendered by the list
13. `./linkItems` - if set to `true` the list will link all items to the corresponding pages
14. `./showDescription` - if set to `true` each item's description will be rendered
15. `./showModificationDate` - if set to `true` each item's last modification date will be rendered
16. `./displayItemAsTeaser` - if set to `true` the rendering of each list item is delegated to the configured teaser component
17. `./excludeCurrentPage` - if set to `true` the current page is excluded from results.
18. `./id` - defines the component HTML ID attribute.

### Deprecated Edit Dialog Properties
1. `./pages` - defines the pages to be rendered, when the `./listFrom` property is set to `static` up to component version `v3`.
               Starting with component version `v4` this property has the following support for backwards compatibility:
 * the pages provided in the property are rendered by the component as before
 * the updated edit dialog shows the pages with new options, on saving the content is created
   in the new format and this property is removed from the content



## Client Libraries
The component uses the `core.wcm.components.list.v4.editor` editor client library category that includes JavaScript
handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.
