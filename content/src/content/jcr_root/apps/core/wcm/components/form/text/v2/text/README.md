Form Text (v2)
====
Text form field component written in HTL.

## Features

* Provides the following type of input:
  * text
  * textarea
  * email
  * telephone
  * date
  * number
  * password
* Custom constraint messages for the above types

### Use Object
The Form Text component uses the `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.form.Text` Sling Model for its Use-object.

### Component Policy Configuration Properties
The following configuration properties are used:

1. `./displayValidation` - defines whether the text field should display a label for the validation messages.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Form Text component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./type` - defines the type of text this field provides; possible values: `text`, `textarea`, `email`, `tel`, `date`, `number`,
`password`
2. `./rows` - defines the number of text lines available in this input field
3. `./jcr:title` - defines the label to use for this field
3. `./hideTitle` - if set to `true`, the label of this field will be hidden
4. `./name` - defines the name of the field, which will be submitted with the form data
5. `./value` - defines the default value of the field
6. `./helpMessage` - defines a help message that can be rendered in the field as a hint for the user
7. `./usePlaceholder` - if set to `true`, the help message will be displayed inside the form input if the field is empty and not focused
8. `./constraintMessage` - defines the message displayed as tooltip when submitting the form if the value does not validate the chosen type
9. `./required` - if set to `true`, this field will be marked as required, not allowing the form to be submitted until the field has a value
10. `./requiredMessage` - defines the message displayed as tooltip when submitting the form if the value is left empty
11. `./readOnly` - if set to `true`, the filed will be read only
12. `./id` - defines the component HTML ID attribute.

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.wcm.components.form.text.v2` client library category that contains a JavaScript component.
It should be added to a relevant site client library using the `embed` property.

It also provides a `core.wcm.components.form.text.v2.editor` editor client library category that includes JavaScript
handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.

## BEM Description
```
BLOCK cmp-form-text
    ELEMENT cmp-form-text__help-block
    ELEMENT cmp-form-text__textarea
    ELEMENT cmp-form-text__text
    ELEMENT cmp-form-text__validation-message
```

## JavaScript Data Attribute Bindings
Apply a `data-cmp-is="formText"` attribute to the wrapper block to enable initialization of the JavaScript component.

The following attributes can be added to the same element to provide options:

1. `data-cmp-constraint-message` - populated with `constraintMessage` from the component's edit dialog
2. `data-cmp-required-message` - populated with  `requiredMessage` from the component's edit dialog

A `data-cmp-hook-form-text="input"` attribute should be added to the input field or textarea so that the JavaScript is able to target it.
